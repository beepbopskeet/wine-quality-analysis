# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis

This project analyzes the Wine Quality dataset from Kaggle using Python.  
It was created as part of the Udemy course **"Veri Bilimi ve Makine Öğrenmesi 2025: 100 Günlük Kamp"** by **Atıl Samancıoğlu**.

The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature visualization, and a basic machine learning model to classify red wine quality.
